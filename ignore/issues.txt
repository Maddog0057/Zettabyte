<TITLE>A-B-C, Easy as Don’t Use Me</TITLE>
<TEXT>An enterprising Zettabytean citizen has begun manufacturing matryoshka dolls of legendary pop star Jack Michaelson without his permission. In response, his management company has been spectacularly persistent in demanding royalties from the dolls’ sales. Contract lawyers, dressed as zombies and petitioning with uncanny rhythm, are camped around the clock outside of the capitol. Tired of the incessant pop music, you have sat down to negotiate a solution.</TEXT>

<OPTION id="0">“I’m thrilled to finally settle this problem,” says Jack Michaelson while moonwalking back and forth in your office, “You see, the matryoshka manufacturers are exploiting my likeness without my permission. That’s theft unless I get a cut. Anyone who disagrees can just beat it.” The pop star exits with his pet monkey in tow.</OPTION>
<OPTION id="1">Entrepreneur Newt Lowe lays a bizarre assortment of white glove-themed matryoshka dolls on your desk. “These are original works of art that the record label did nothing to create. Just because my work may RESEMBLE famous people like, say Mr. Michaelson or yourself, doesn’t mean I’ve stolen anything. It’s not so black and white, the question of image laws.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="2">“You’re forgetting the bigger problem,” pontificates Tanya Silk, while carving a matryoshka doll in the old style, “These pop art abominations are ruining our Zettabytean culture. I’m sick and tired of foreign pop music and other trash drowning out our national customs. Tradition dictates that a matryoshka doll is a series of nested babushki, not postmodern kitsch like political figures and disco stars.”</OPTION>

<OPTION id="0">“I think you’ll find there’s actually no problem here,” observes conservative speaker and hair care product salesperson Heidi English. “A student wants to go to a particular school, but lacks the grades. Clearly, he should have studied harder in school. But oh, because he’s a so-called minority, it’s everyone else’s fault. I’m sorry, but the system is working perfectly well: What gets you into a good school is merit alone. Or, failing that, a generous donation.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="1">“Are you blind, or do you simply refuse to see?” thunders civil-rights activist, former TV commentator and unabashed publicity speaker Manuel MacDonald. “Oh yes, it’s all perfectly equal, if we ignore the fact that this poor boy was stacking shelves to pay for textbooks in a falling-down school while the nice rich boys were enjoying private tutoring! Affirmative action is needed to balance out the very real disadvantages that many students grow up with! And there’s no better way to identify that disadvantage than with broad, sweeping demographics!”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="2">“I think you’re both loony,” says Sashona Silva, professor of liberal arts at Zettabyte National University. “In my humble opinion, the solution is simple: make college education free to all. Why turn away anyone? Throw open the gates and make college education available to every citizen of Zettabyte, regardless of their economic status, grades, or work ethic!”</OPTION>

<OPTION id="0">Social activist Ruby Fallon is outraged. “Gambling needs to be outlawed immediately. It’s no wonder children are becoming sucked into the vice, with adults setting such a poor example. Gambling is a stain on Zettabyte’s international reputation and it must be stopped!”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="1">However, Crown Casino chairperson Alina Maldonado says, “What’s wrong with children gambling? It prepares them for the realities of life, teaching them that success or failure is not due to hard work or intelligence, but the roll of the dice. Besides, if kids weren’t gambling, they’d be spray painting trains.”</OPTION>

<OPTION id="0">“Every night my family and I sit down to watch ‘The Brash and the Backstabbing’,” says Sydney Breitbart. “But where are the Lilliputians like myself? Where are the Bigtopians? The Marche Noirians? People from those cultures can be just as brash and backstabbing, but we never see them on the screen. The government must act to remove this silent apartheid from our TV screens.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="1">“Those Lilliputians don’t know how good they have it,” says Bianca Harris, spokesperson for the Tasmanians Against Ethnic Stereotyping. “Tasmanians are on television all the time, but always in crude, stereotypical roles. The answer is not to enforce ethnic quotas, but to award government prizes for the positive portrayal of minorities. That’ll work better, and be cheaper, too.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="2">“The government should do what now?” says TV studio executive Gabriel Octavian. “You’ve got to be kidding. We make soaps here, not documentaries. I should be able to put whichever characters I want into my shows. Quotas! Government prizes! God save me! Hasn’t the government got anything better to do? Why don’t they just back off and let society work out these things on its own?”</OPTION>

<OPTION id="0">“The state of the education system is, in many areas, simply frightful,” says Teachers Union leader Matt Morricone. “And even where we are doing well, we could do better. I appeal to the authorities for a substantial boost in funding. Remember, the children are our future.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="1">“We won’t have a future unless we improve police numbers and rebuild the military,” says General Siko Swift. “Oh, it’s all well and good to have your fancy education and your nice cars, until some tinpot dictatorship decides to invade. And don’t pretend like there aren’t any of them in our region. Our number one priority has to be security.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="2">“Education is nice, but Health and Social Welfare are more important,” says celebrity social worker Athena Carter. “This is where the people who really need government help are: the marginalized of our society. If we don’t help them, what kind of a nation are we?”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="3">“Hey, I’ve got a crazy idea,” says noted libertarian and bird-watcher Engelbert Howard. “How about the government stops taking so much tax from people? Give us a tax cut and we’ll buy the things we need ourselves. People need to be weaned off the government teat!”</OPTION>
